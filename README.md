# License Agreement <a name="licenseagreement"/>
Note that using this template is subject to the conditions of this [License Agreement](AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf).
Please review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. In short, you are allowed to use the template for free with Mule ESB Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
Use this template if would like to sync Contacts from SAP to Salesforce in manner of one time synchronization by hitting the HTTP endpoint. 
		Inbound SAP endpoint retrieves all Contacts in SAP using standard BAPI  **BAPI_CUSTOMER_GETCONTACTLIST** and transforms them to Salesforce Contacts
		In this template you may choose whether Account for Contact should be created as well during the migration process. 
		This functionality relies on standard BAPI for retrieving details about customers **BAPI_CUSTOMER_GETDETAIL2**

# Considerations <a name="considerations"/>

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered.
All of them deal with the preparations in both source (SAP) and destination (SFDC) systems, that must be made in order for everything to run smoothly.
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before using this Anypoint Template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies from Mulesoft in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, you need to add three extra dependencies for SAP to the pom.xml file.


## SAP Considerations <a name="sapconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding SAP, in order for this template to work.

### As source of data

SAP backend system is used as source of data. SAP Connector is used to send and receive the data from the SAP backend. 
The connector can either use RFC calls of BAPI functions and/or IDoc messages for data exchange and needs to be properly customized as per chapter: [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)



## Salesforce Considerations <a name="salesforceconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding Salesforce, in order for this template to work.

In order to have this template working as expected, you should be aware of your own Salesforce field configuration.

### FAQ

# Run it! <a name="runit"/>
Simple steps to get SAP to Salesforce contact migration running.


## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
In this section we detail the way you should run your Anypoint Template on your computer.


### Where to Download Mule Studio and Mule ESB
First thing to know if you are a newcomer to Mule is where to get the tools.

+ You can download Mule Studio from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio)
+ You can download Mule ESB from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb)


### Importing an Anypoint Template into Studio
Mule Studio offers several ways to import a project into the workspace, for instance: 

+ Anypoint Studio Project from File System
+ Packaged mule application (.jar)

You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio).


### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application (configure)"`
+ Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `"mule.env"` to the value `"dev"`
+ Click `"Run"`
In order to make this Anypoint Template run on Anypoint Studio there are a few extra steps that needs to be made.
Please check this Documentation Page:

+ [Enabling Your Studio Project for SAP](https://docs.mulesoft.com/connectors/sap-connector#configuring-the-connector-in-studio-7)

### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**.


### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub <a name="deployingyouranypointtemplateoncloudhub"/>
Mule Studio provides you with really easy way to deploy your Template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)


## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>
In order to use this Mule Anypoint Template you need to configure properties (Credentials, configurations, etc.) either in properties file or in CloudHub as Environment Variables. Detail list with examples:
### Application configuration
**HTTP Connector configuration**
+ http.port `9090`

**SAP Connector configuration**

+ sap.jco.ashost `your.sap.address.com`
+ sap.jco.user `SAP_USER`
+ sap.jco.passwd `SAP_PASS`
+ sap.jco.sysnr `14`
+ sap.jco.client `800`
+ sap.jco.lang `EN`

**SalesForce Connector configuration**

+ sfdc.username `bob.dylan@sfdc`
+ sfdc.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`

**SMTP Services configuration**

+ smtp.host `smtp.gmail.com`
+ smtp.port `587`
+ smtp.user `gmailuser`
+ smtp.password `gmailpassword`

**Mail details**

+ mail.from `your.email@gmail.com`
+ mail.to `your.email@gmail.com`
+ mail.subject `Mail subject`

**Policy for creating accounts in SF syncAccount, doNotCreateAccount**

+ account.sync.policy `syncAccount`

# API Calls <a name="apicalls"/>
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made.
Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to
consider. Product Broadcast Template calls to the API can be
calculated using the formula:

**X * 3 + X / 200**

Being X the number of Contacts to be synchronized on each run.

Multiplication by 3 is because for every user if account.sync.policy is set to value **syncAccounts** for every contact will be checked
if an account with matching name exists in Salesforce and if not it will be created.

The division by 200 is because, by default, contacts are gathered in groups
of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. 

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 31 api
calls to SFDC will be made (worst case scenario). If accounts already exist or syncing of accounts is disabled, there will be fewer API calls made.


# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Anypoint Template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Anypoint Template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [endpoints.xml](#endpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
Configuration for Connectors and [Configuration Properties](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. **Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow that will check for Salesforce creations/updates. The several message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Template:
1. Migration process starts from fetching all the existing Contacts that match the filter criteria from SAP.
2. Then each SAP Contact will be checked by name against Salesforce, if it has an existing matching objects in Salesforce.
3. Account associated with SAP Contact is migrated to Account associated with Contact in Salesforce. The matching is performed by querying a Salesforce instance for an entry with name same as the given SAP Account name.
4. Then the upsert of Contact in Salesforce is performed.
5. Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Template will log output statistics data into the console and send email.



## endpoints.xml<a name="endpointsxml"/>
This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Template has only an [HTTP Listener Connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Listener+Connector) as the way to trigger the use case.
### Trigger Flow
**HTTP Listener Connector** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migratecontacts` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is a *request-response* and a result of calling it is the response with the total records fetched by the criteria specified.



## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
This is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions. 
This file holds a [Error Handling](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Error+Handling) that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
